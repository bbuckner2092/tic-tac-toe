# tic-tac-toe
1.) I was able to get the actually table sizes by making sure I got the borders right.
2.) I got stuck because I did not use the classes horizontal or vertical
	When I used these classes I was going to apply to each td instead of just using it for specific ones.
3.) I also got stuck moving the table
	Initially, I used the text-align auto and even center and right but it was only supposed to be table {margin: auto;}
